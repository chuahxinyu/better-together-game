A local co-op platformer where two defective robots embark on a quest to find a scientist who can repair them. The robots, who narrowly escaped incineration, must work together by separating and connecting to navigate through a series of challenging levels filled with obstacles, traps and enemies.

Players can control the robot either using a single keyboard (WASD and Arrow Buttons) or using the on-screen touch controls or both. The game can be played alone, but as the game title suggests, it is better played together!
